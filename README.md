# Arweave-For-Wordpress
Once again this does not work yet......

# Please excuse the mess

Hoping to use this to integrate an arweave data archiver / and wallet into wordpress

# Insructions
The plugin does install and puts a menu in the admin panel sidebar. Or it did the last time i worked on it.

# To Do
1. Make it function

2. Add data validation and sanitation

3. Use wordpress functions wherever possible
